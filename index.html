    <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Today's blog is about my recent trip to hyderabad</p>
    <img  style=" display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;" height="350" width="350"src="https://www.onmycanvas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hyderabad-streets-and-charminar.jpeg" alt="charminar">
    <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The present-day Hyderabad can be divided into the historic city on the southern side of the Musi River and the New City on the northern banks. Though most of the historical places in Hyderabad are in the old city, this division is hardly visible. 

        Now Hyderabad bustles like a fortress from the past equipped with modern cars and glass skyscrapers. While on one side the Charminar reminds us of Hyderabad’s Nizami heritage, on the other side cabs full of white-collared millennials rush to the Hitech city. Laad Bazaar is as popular as Mega Shopping Mall. While Golconda fort is a weekend’s delight for many, the GVK Inox isn’t forgotten. KFC might have a long queue, but Shah Ghouse Cafe is even busier.
        
        Hyderabad is an interesting blend of modern and traditional. You can explore this city if you are ready to elbow your way through crowded streets or stand in the queue for as long as it takes. These are just battles you have to win in Hyderabad. Day 1 – Start your first day in Hyderabad by visiting Purani Haveli and Chowmallah Palace. Go to Charminar, Laad Bazaar, and Mecca Masjid in the evening. These are some of the most beautiful Hyderabad sites. 

        Day 2 – On your second day in Hyderabad, visit the Qutb Shahi tombs, the Taramati Baradari near the tombs, Golconda Fort, and Falaknuma Palace. These places would take almost all day. 
        
        Day 3 – On day three in Hyderabad, go to the Shilparamam handicraft center. (You can also go to Birla Mandir.) Then I suggest walking around the Charminar again and wandering in the labyrinth of Hyderabadi streets. Who knows what you might find!
